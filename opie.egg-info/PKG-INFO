Description: # opie: OpenStack Preemptible Instances Extensions
        
        opie is the materialization of the [preemptible instances extension][1]
        serving as a reference implementation. This package provides a set of
        pluggable extensions for [OpenStack Compute (nova)](http://openstack.org)
        making possible to execute premptible instances using a modified filter
        scheduler.
        
        [1]: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/openstack/?searchtext=preemptible-instances
        
        opie is completely pluggable, with the exception of a modification in the
        internal nova compute API that needs to be applied manually.
